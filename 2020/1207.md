## Because I always forget how mocking things work in Jest

```typescript
import { getThing } from './Thing';

jest.mock('./Thing');

test('thing', () => {
    (getThing as jest.Mock).mockImplementation(() => ({
        aMethod: () => Promise.resolve(null),
    }));
});
```

I still find jest mocks a bit cludgy vs sinon and usually have to wrestle a bit with it.
