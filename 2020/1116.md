## More typescript brain melt

This was more on last week, but learning about [index types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#index-types) and how to use it in one case where we have a method like:

    // can return multiple types, but it would be nice to know what type it is...
    get(key: string): Promise<any>

So you can do:

    get<K extends keyof Data>(key: K): Promise<Data[k]>

## Generics for interfaces

Was struggling a bit with interfaces that then use generics. Initially had:

    interface Jsonable {
        toJSON(): any;
    }

Didn't like that it was any, but changing to `toJSON<T>(): T` doesn't help. The solution was to move the generic to the interface, not the method:

    interface Jsonable<T> {
        toJSON(): T;
    }

Then `class Something implements Jsonable<Data>`
