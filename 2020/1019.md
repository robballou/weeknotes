## `--trace-warnings`

One our test suites would eventually get a warning about `MaxListenersExceededWarning`. Running tests with `--trace-warnings` allowed me to see the stack for when that occurred and discover that we have a global event emitter that never gets reset.

## babel & finally removing polyfill

Recently changed a project's babel configuration to:

```javascript
["@babel/preset-env", {
    "useBuiltIns": "entry",
    "corejs": 3,
    "modules": false,
    "targets": {
        "chrome": "79",
        "edge": "79"
    }
}],
```

This helps eliminate the need for polyfill and regenerator-runtime. But it also meant that tests started failing, but I was able to fix that by copying this configuration to where we have `@babel/register` and changing `modules` to `true`. These changes allowed us to remove `@babel/polyfill`, `core-js`, `regenerator-runtime`, and one babel plugin.
