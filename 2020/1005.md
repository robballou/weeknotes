## React & Typescript: Dynamic setState

When doing a partial `setState()` in React/Typescript, you can use this to do it dynamically:

```typescript
onOptionChange = (name: keyof State, value: unknown) => {
    this.setState({[name]: value} as Pick<State, keyof State>);
};
```

In this case, we would pass something like `onOptionChange('mystatekey', 1234)` to change that key.
