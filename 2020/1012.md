## React & Typescript: `defaultProps` & prop types

Currently have some projects with are only in TS that use both prop types and types. Probably should move to just types:

- https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-0.html#support-for-defaultprops-in-jsx
- Having both propTypes and types also mean maintaining both.
- Nested object defaultProps can be done with `const myDefault...` and `function MyComponent({ objectProp = myDefault })...`

## CSS centering with flexbox

Vertical center some content with Flex:

```CSS
display: flex;
flex-direction: column;
justify-content: center;
```
