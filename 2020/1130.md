## React useState & useCallback

I found a component where we had:

```typescript
const [isShowingHelp, setIsShowingHelp] = useState(false);
const dismissHelpClicked = useCallback(() => {
    setIsShowingHelp(false);
}, [setIsShowingHelp]);
```

I was questioning the use of `useCallback` here and general concensus is that's really not doing much besides adding complexity since `setIsShowingHelp` isn't going to knowingly change at any point. **Note:** additionally, it should be pointed out that you don't need a state setter as part of dependencies here...

## Random: Coffee

Shopping with a mask made shopping for coffee beans a challenge, but am happy to blind pickup [these beans](https://blkandbold.com/collections/fair-trade-specialty-coffees/products/rise-grnd-blend-1). I'm not a coffee snop and these fits nicely into the morning cup of coffee realm for me.
