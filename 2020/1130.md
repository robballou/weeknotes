## React useState & useCallback

I found a component where we had:

```typescript
const [isShowingHelp, setIsShowingHelp] = useState(false);
const dismissHelpClicked = useCallback(() => {
    setIsShowingHelp(false);
}, [setIsShowingHelp]);
```

I was questioning the use of `useCallback` here and general concensus is that's really not doing much besides adding complexity since `setIsShowingHelp` isn't going to knowingly change at any point.
