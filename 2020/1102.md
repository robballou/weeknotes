## Nested types in Typescript

```typescript
type NestedStringArray = (string | string[])[];
```

## Soundbar

I recently got a soundbar and had some trouble with audio syncing with connected devices. I switched the sound to "pass through" mode and now it's better.

## Entertainment recommendations

As November 5 fell during this week, I continued my tradition of watching _V for Vendetta_, this year on BluRay.

I also binged _The Queen's Gambit_ on Netflix which was very good.

## Return to yoga?

Sunday night I did my first home yoga session in a while which was a nice workout for my back issues. I think I really need to add a few session in each week.
