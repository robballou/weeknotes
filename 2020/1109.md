## Typescript Record

I recently starting using `Record<string, string>` in places where I'd have `type Thing = { [key: string]: string }`. Then on a project I had this:

```typescript
type SomeRecords = {
    [key: string]: RecordType;
}

type RecordType = {
    example: 'example';
}

const records: SomeRecords = {
    thing: { example: 'example' }
}

const firstThing = records['thing' as keyof SomeRecords];
```

When I switched `SomeRecords` to `Record<string, RecordType>`, the `firstThing` line would blow up. The fix was simply dropping `as keyof SomeRecords` as TS will now recognize `'thing'` is valid for that record type.
