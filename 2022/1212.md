## Backpacking Gear

This year, I set a goal of backpacking at least one night per month for all 12 months. Happily, this last weekend I finished that goal with a final quick overnight. And so I think now is a good time to break down what gear I have used this year.

### Base gear (things that didn't change)

Firstly, I have a spreadsheet with a basic setup of this gear. When I am preparing a new trip, I copy that sheet and clear the checks I use while packing. I then can adjust things based on the trip.

I have been using a [Superior Wilderness Designs' Long Haul](https://www.swdbackpacks.com/product-page/SWD-LongHaul-UltralightBackpack) for a couple season now and love this pack. It's just big enough for my gear loadout plus reasonable amount of food. During cold weather or long water/food carries I might need to move more things to the outside of the pack. In summer mode though, it's all contained on the inside and in the mesh pocket. I have both hip pockets, and had a shoulder pocket too but that recently died at the hands of some rodents. This year I did tear a hole in the mesh while navigating around a downed tree but repaired it with tape. SWD packs are great cause of how much you can customize it and remove pockets, straps, and even the frame if you wanted. I _might_ update this to one of their new offerings or a slightly bigger size if I aim for week+ trips.

Sometimes I found it helpful to carry a hippack for a few extra items I wanted at hand. I picked up a [Waymark Gear](https://waymarkgearco.com/) hip pack which does not seem to be available. It has one pocked with a divider and one extra little slip pocket for things like a map or other item.

Since each trip was with my dog, Finn, I went with a two person shelter for all trips. Except for January and Feburary, this year that meant using my [Zpacks Duplex](https://zpacks.com/products/duplex-tent). This tent has held up great so far. My two cautions on this is that is a little finky to setup sometimes and I think it really strong storms it might not be enough. For short trips where I know the weather or pick camp sites well, it's great, light, and packs small. I was worried about the floor material and my dog but so far it has been fine. Additionally, I kind of liked the design of my [Gossamer Gear The Two](https://www.gossamergear.com/products/the-two) more, but the DCF version was not available when I needed to upgrade. The Duplex is spendy though. I couple this with a polycro sheet cut to size for a foot print.

Other base gear:

- Polycro pack liner for keeping stuff in the pack dry
- Sea to summit ultralight pillow
- [Gossamer Gear thinlight pad](https://www.gossamergear.com/products/thinlight-foam-pad) (sleeping pad for my dog; sit/nap pad for me during the day)
- Usually water setup: 2 1.5L smart water bottles, empty [CNOC 2L bag](https://cnocoutdoors.com/collections/hydration/products/vecto-28mm) for filtering water, [Sawyer Squeeze Filter](https://www.sawyer.com/products/squeeze-water-filtration-system), extra water treatment drops for when things go awry. This lets me get 5.5L which covers most of my dry camp needs. Sometimes I switch out or carry extra water with more smart water bottles of various sizes or an Evernew 2L bag. One trip this spring I cached water on our route as the only supply of water was not going to be switched on yet.
- First aid (various things that stay the same year round including some dog first aid)
- Mini compass (provides just enough detail if I need a backup for no phone situations)
- InReach Mini communicator & SOS beacon
- Trowel/bidet/TP
- Ursack food bag plus polycro bag
- BSR Stove, lighter, repair gear
- Usually an Anker powerbank, but sometimes I use a smaller one for overnights; various cables
- Wired headphones (sleeping, or listening to music/books while camped near others)
- Nitecore nu25 headlamp
- Two [Cascade Mountain Tech hiking poles](https://www.amazon.com/Cascade-Mountain-Tech-Trekking-Poles/dp/B096XDQFDM) with the straps removed. These double as tent poles.
- Either a 550ml or 750ml Ti Toaks pot, sometimes a Ti mug if I am cooking breakfast as well as coffee.
- Heavy old flask for beverages
- Benchmade Bugout Mini knife
- Garmin Instinct watch for tracking data, compass, etc.

For navigation, I will use [COTrex](https://trails.colorado.gov) in Colorado plus GaiaGPS for anywhere. Both allow me to have maps offline and generally know where I am based on that data. For bigger loops I print a map and keep track of where I am on that as I go. I generally use a Gaia link to share my route with family and friends. Sometimes I use CalTopo instead if I want to mark water or camps or use some of it's features Gaia doesn't have. I don't use that app though.

### Sleeping bag

For most of the year, I use an older [Katabatic Gear Palisade 30º](https://katabaticgear.com/collections/elite-quilts/products/palisade-ultralight-quilt) coupled with a short [Thermarest Xlite](https://www.thermarest.com/sleeping-pads/fast-and-light/neoair-xlite-sleeping-pad/neoair-xlite.html). If it might be slightly cooler but I don't want to switch quilts, I will add a liner.

When it's going to be >10º<30º I will switch to my [Enlighted Equipment Engima 10º](https://enlightenedequipment.com/enigma-custom). I find the Katabatic a bit more true to it's temperature, so if it will be below 20º I usually add a liner here. I also switch to an older Nemo full length pad which has a slightly better R value and keeps me off the cold ground. For really cold temps, I will add a short zlite pad for extra insulation from the ground and finally might switch to a massive 0º sleeping bag ... which only comes out for true winter camping. Colder than that? I don't usually go camping :D

### Clothing

My wearing-while-hiking clothing is pretty subjective to the trip. But often I have a long sleeve wind layer, hooded long sleeve sun layer, and shorts. Most of the year, I just bring a really light Montbell down jacket and a pair of super lightweight liner gloves. Combined with my Zpacks rain jacket and pants, that might be the only warmth I bring. As it gets colder, I add various leggings, midlayers, a vest, warm hats, gloves, etc. For this year I discovered that even carrying my normal puffy jacket and a second puffy jacket was nice for in camp on those January-February nights.

I swear by Topo Athletic shoes for hiking. In winter I do have some of their waterproof boots for snowshoeing, etc.

### Dog gear

Finn has a [Ruffwear Palisades pack](https://ruffwear.com/products/palisades-pack) which is a harness and backpack. This year, I ended up carrying some more of his gear so he normally carries:

- Two meals of his food
- Poop bags and any poop
- A ruffwear collasible food bowl
- A ruffwear collasible water bowl
- Dog socks incase he hurts his pads
- A "silenced" bear bell (makes a little bit of noise but not full out)
- His warm jacket

I have some bandages and pills in my first aid for him in case. For longer trips, I will often carry a probiotic powder to put on his food to keep his stomach happier.

For his sleeping, I usually carry an older, no longer available dog bed or a down blanket. In cold weather, I bring both. He used to carry all of it which was still well below the recommended weight but he gets warm and he is getting older, so I like to keep things off him when I can. Sometimes I might carry his pack during the afternoon to help out ;)

Finn, especially after years of hiking, is generally good off leash but in most circumstances I keep him on leash. To do this I have a climbing loop & biner attached to the hipbelt of my pack for hands free carrying. He sometimes likes to hike behind me which makes managing the leash a pain so I have an extra non-climbing biner attached to my pack that allows me to hook the leash a second time when he is behind me to keep it from dangling.

### Camera

This year I got my pack weight down enough I often carry my Sony A7C camera with one lens. I use a [Peak Design capture clip](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/capture) to attach the camera to my pack. Otherwise I just use my phone for snaps or videos. I keep one or more dry bags around in case weather moves in.
