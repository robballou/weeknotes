## Mocking getBoundingClientRect

We have some components that use [`getBoundingClientRect()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect) to figure out their width/height. This was one way I found to mock that.

```typescript
let tree;
renderer.act(() => {
    tree = renderer.create(component, {
        createNodeMock: () => ({
            getBoundingClientRect: jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => ({ width: 1000 })),
        }),
    });
});
expect(tree.toJSON()).toMatchSnapshot();
```

## xstate

Someone shared this and might be worth digging into later: https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate

## Presidential impeachment

For the second time, President Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives today for inciting insurrection. We probably won't have a Senate trial till after the inauguration but I wanted to note this down as a historic thing that is happening during this time. He is the first president to be impeached twice.
