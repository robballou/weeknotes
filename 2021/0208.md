## OOP Battles

Often I see OSS projects that have code like:

```
class CoolStuff {
  private thingYouWantToUse = 'asdf';

  function someMethod() {
    //...

    $thing = new CoolStuffSupportingClass();

    //...
  }
}
```

And here you cannot use `thingYouWantToUse` or change what `someMethod` is doing.

## This Week I Learned

- *obsequious*: obedient or attentive to an excessive or servile degree
