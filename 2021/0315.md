## Chrome captions

This would be interesting to check out at some point:

## navigator.permissions.query

Found an interesting case where an add-in we are making does not have permission in chrome to write to the clipboard API. So I added a call to query for the permissions. Turns out Firefox *and* the typescript definition for this don't like `clipboard-write` even though that is supported by the spec & Chrome, so:

```typescript
let canUseClipboard = true;
try {
    const permissionStatus = await navigator.permissions.query({
        name: 'clipboard-write' as PermissionName,
    });
    if (permissionStatus.state === 'denied') {
        console.warn('copy denied');
        canUseClipboard = false;
    }
    console.info('copy allowed');
}
catch (err) {
    console.warn('could not detect copy ability, default to true');
    /* intentional */
}
```

In Firefox, this will fail to detect whether we can copy... but in this case we can.
